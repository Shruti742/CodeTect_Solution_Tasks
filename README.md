### Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website created using **HTML** and **CSS** to showcase the skills, projects, and contact information of Shruti Pandit, a front-end developer. The website is designed to be simple, clean, and user-friendly, offering a professional way to highlight my work and skills. The site consists of multiple sections, including an **About Me** section, a **Projects** section, and a **Contact** form. The layout is responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

### Structure of the Code

The code is divided into two main components: **HTML** (for the structure) and **CSS** (for the styling). The **HTML** defines the layout and content of the website, while the **CSS** controls how the website looks, including colors, fonts, spacing, and responsiveness.

1. **HTML**:
    - The **header** section contains the website's logo (my name, Shruti Pandit) and a navigation bar with links to different sections of the portfolio (About, Projects, and Contact).
    - The **About** section introduces who I am, what I do, and what technologies I am proficient in.
    - The **Projects** section showcases different projects I’ve worked on. Each project is displayed in a card layout with a title and a description.
    - The **Contact** section contains a simple form for users to reach out to me. The form includes fields for the user's name, email, and message, along with a button to submit the form.

2. **CSS**:
    - The CSS is used to style the page, making it visually appealing and organized. Key design choices include a **dark header** with white text, a **light background** for the main content, and a **box-shadow** effect on project cards to make them stand out.
    - The layout is **responsive**, which means the site adapts to different screen sizes using media queries. For example, the project cards will stack vertically on smaller screens (like mobile devices) to make the best use of limited space.
    - The **contact form** is styled with padding, borders, and rounded corners to make it easy to fill out and visually consistent with the rest of the design.
    - The navigation bar is styled with a **flexbox** layout, allowing the items to be spaced evenly and align well across different screen sizes.

### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts automatically to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, ensuring the website looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple Navigation**: The website includes a simple navigation bar that lets visitors easily jump to the **About**, **Projects**, and **Contact** sections.
- **Project Showcase**: Projects are displayed in a clean, card-based layout. Each card includes a project name and description, allowing potential clients or employers to quickly see examples of my work.
- **Contact Form**: The contact section includes a form that allows visitors to send me a message directly through the website (though the form submission functionality needs to be handled separately, such as with a backend service).

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: The structure of the website, including headings, paragraphs, links, and forms.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the website, including layout, typography, and responsiveness.
- **Flexbox**: Used in the navigation and layout to create a flexible, responsive structure.
- **Media Queries**: Ensures the website is fully responsive across different screen sizes, from desktops to tablets and smartphones.

### Conclusion
This portfolio website serves as an online resume and showcases my skills as a front-end developer. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, making it easy to share with potential clients or employers. The code is clean and organized, and the design is simple yet effective, ensuring a professional appearance on any device.
